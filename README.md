🚨 TraceX – DFIR Platform

TraceX is a Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR) platform designed to help detect, analyze, and respond to cyber incidents involving virtual number misuse and network protocol vulnerabilities.

🔍 Project Overview

With the rise of cyberbullying, phishing, and online fraud, attackers often misuse virtual phone numbers to stay anonymous. At the same time, wireless and distributed network protocols may contain hidden vulnerabilities that attackers exploit.

TraceX addresses both problems using an automated DFIR framework built on Google Cloud technologies.
